                <h2>Ethernal Spear</h2>
                <p>
                    Repeated long-range stab attacks that can be charged to unleash a spin attack dealing high damage in a wide radius. The special throws the spear, which will damage enemies along its path until it stops. Activating special again recalls the spear, which will deal damage on the way back.

                <h2>Stygian Blade</h2>
                <p>
                    The blade's default attack pattern is a three-swing long combo consisting of a mixture of wide and directional swings. The special creates a small burst around you after a short jump, and leaves you stationary for a short time.

                <h2>Twin Fist</h2>
                <p>
                    The main attack is a single swing that hits in an arc and knocks enemies back. Holding the attack button will block damage from the front, while charging the "Bull Rush". Releasing this will perform a shield bash forwards, dealing damage to enemies hit. The special throws the shield, which bounces between enemies and objects before returning.

                <p>
                    Ranged attacks that hit enemies at a distance. The main attack can be charged to increase distance and damage, releasing at the right moment for additional damage. The special sprays arrows in a cone in front of you, dealing 10 damage each.

                    Automatic or manual fire (depending on whether Attack is pressed or held) that must be reloaded once all ammo is used. The special launches a grenade to bombard the target area, which takes a short time to arrive but deals damage in an area once it lands.
